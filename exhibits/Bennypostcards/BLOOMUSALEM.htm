<p><font size="4">Apparently talmudists have deciphered 613 commandments within the Torah.
The last one has garnered a bit of attention. Has to do with Deuteronomy 31:19. One is to
write out a Torah book in one&#146;s lifetime. Or as a French rabbi of the Derridean
school puts it: &quot;&#133;several important fragments shed light on the project of
fragmentary writing as a criticism of the Work as a totality.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Eliot&#146;s footnotes. I&#146;d rather not know. Every phrase we utter
needs annotation. The pop-in from Seinfeld, don&#146;t you know. How far we&#146;ve come
from <i>see Buddah&#146;s Fire Sermon</i>. The walking narratives need accompanying
professors. This was said because this is his history. Apparently he watched many
episodes. A common affliction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Leopold Bloom&#146;s Hungarian connection. Asian tribes known as Avars
settle in Hungary. My father and myself are crossing each other. Congress of Asian
scholars taking place in Budapest. The Gods must be crazy. I&#146;ll be there with bells
on.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I in Hebrew Studies section. He in Mongolian Studies. What a team. A
joke. I&#146;m better received. To speak of physical origins in most academic circles is
taboo. Nothing essential please.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Information found in anthropological databases. Used to construct his
identity, I use to deconstruct same. My arrogance and shame.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Crossraods of East and West in Budapest. Romans stopped at the steppes
of Buda. Beyond was Heathenish.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Two things my father insists about his own father. That he was a plumber
for the Kremlin and that he was actually a Siberian/Buryat Mongol. Not compatible
genetically with his Jewish mother. Therefore the acrimony and the deranged children. In
the genes, baby.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dementia of a Howard Hughes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Saul Bellow. Accused of racism. And what did you do asks Stoppard.
Reading <i>Herzog</i> I see Dublin. The bend in Chicago&#146;s Lake Shore Drive no longer
is there, as is the case with Dublin&#146;s Nighttown. That bend shall throw off any
accusations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My father asked I.B. Singer for some translation work. Threw him out
with $10. Bellow would do. A few years before I.B. Singer chattted up my mother. She had
no idea what he was after. Realizing this, he ended his pursuit. Saul Bellow was better
than you father, wasn&#146;t he?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">James Joyce is known to have fathered Jewish children. One is Bellow.
Was the other my own father. No. Joyce is responsible for legitimate offspring worthy of
the lineage. He did better than God.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That time in the field back in Kyriat Ata. The Arab teens speaking
Hebrew making fun of you, dad. What did they perceive? In the woods near the field I
created my world. Seven years old I dreamt of trapping you and killing you. If not
mythology than what?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Pin me down Lacan. Please fix me. Israel early seventies. Insecurity of
a nation. Makes for an insecure child. Gruzinim, Georgians, would beat the shit out of me.
What happened to a brotherhood of Jews? I&#146;ll tell you why we can&#146;t all get
along. It is no fun.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>The Singing Detective </i>took (sorry Carlin) I mean had a shit on a
teacher&#146;s desk. An analyst explains to him his actions. Saw his mom shagging in the
woods. I set the woods on fire. Seven or eight and I brought fire trucks to douse burning
bushes in Israel. I knew exactly what I was doing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Shape me Duras writes. The &quot;A&quot; bomb or the man? I keep
forgetting the artificiality of the public private split. I&#146;m in a long line of
literary buffoons whose vision of their father takes a turn for the worse. Biff Loman for
a start.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chingis, that is Ghengis Khan, is on Mongolia&#146;s currency. Cool. His
quotes no doubt are as verifiable as Jesus&#146;s but they are nifty. Obviously
you&#146;re not in God&#146;s favor or else he would not have visited on you a punishment
like me. An honest politician. Brought Europe out of its slumber.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hightower from <i>Light in August</i>. Thought his grandfather died
gloriously in battle against the Union. Shot raiding a chicken coop. Now that&#146;s
modernism.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tells people that he is a Buryat Mongol. A goddamn child. &quot;But I
have trouble explaining my circumcision.&quot; From one of the lost minds. Jewish
genealogy takes a new twist. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rushed to a Catholic hospital, I told the young cleric <i>It</i> was
hard. Delirious overdose and still able to be reminded of Amadaeus. You are mediocre like
me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">How can one beat the impotence in Israel scene Roth gave us. It should
be added to the <i>Apocrypha</i>. Hebrew not rich enough. Stuff sheets of <i>Portnoy </i>in
the wall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Seven years old and I zealously took notes out of the crevices. Litter I
thought. The shame when told bits of paper are sacred wishes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The actor playing a Nazi in a Mel Brooks film plays a rabbi 20 years
later in a Woody Allen film. An inside joke!</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It can&#146;t be possible that I remember so much of my internment in
Israel. Waiting for a father to set up an acupuncture clinic in the land of very few
Chinese. What was mom thinking?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I&#146;ve been made to pay for extracting those words out of The Wall.
The next day he put me on the train to Haifa. I was in the way. A child traveling alone.
Forgot where my mother&#146;s office was. No one cared much to help me find it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>Orientalism</i>. Some literary genre. Those in Palestine were of an
exotic Eastern race. All those Office Maxes I gather are from the West. Kosher Chinese is
the closest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I&#146;m sure Roth thinks he&#146;s more Jewish than the <i>frum</i>. A
prophet. Not too nice to his women. On Terry Gross compares himself to Joyce. Joyce
wasn&#146;t an hysteric.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A Moroccan and a Russian showed me theirs after forcing me to show me
mine. They were put up to it by the Georgians. No shit Stalin was one.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Read to her from <i>Light in August</i> and then took the pills. A
misreading. Paramedics made fun that I didn&#146;t take enough. Part of their training.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Took a towel for the beach. Hour ride to the Mediterranean. Red flag
warning black forbidden. By myself sever or eight going to the beach in the Holy Land.
Insaner than that kid in that Aiken story.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She said that she was conceived by parents on acid. Maybe 10% of the
population. Crack babies get better press.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So you&#146;ve got Robbe-Grillet&#146;s jealousy and Proust&#146;s
version. Anxiety, anticipation in both. Yes I know, the famous &quot;no&quot; between
Proust and Joyce. Yes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Decided not to attend school for a year. The Jewish state won&#146;t
control me. Watched T.V. Neighbors begin to talk. Can&#146;t be told what to do.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A few days before Passover I horde several loaves of bread. I won&#146;t
follow your customs. I got my own.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fragments shorn! Fragments shorn! Good price! Handfuls of dust thrown
in! Get them while they last!</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>Herzog</i> contains a description of a rabbi with Mongolian features.
I&#146;m hot on your trail father. Howard Street mentioned, I live a block a way. How do
these shamans know?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Arendt-Heidegger collaboration says it all. The trajectories of
desire. We need the other.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A standard question of the hack psychologist: Is there mental illness in
the family? Judge me on my own demerits. He hadn&#146;t heard of Durkheim. I&#146;m better
read but he can put me away.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Such horrendous fear of women is other-worldly. Kafka had a fear of his
father but the female he could deal with. Yea Yea it&#146;s myself I fear.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Joyce stayed out of fascist politics. A difficult feat. Liked Jews a lot
more than Proust. Large debate over Bloom&#146;s Jewishness. Let us pray the Rabbinute
doesn&#146;t rule on it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The point is that the Jewish writers used <i>Ulysses</i> as their Torah.
Marriage of Hebrew and Celt.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If only he hadn&#146;t been so astoundingly selfish. Abandoning his
people in the Levant for Yellow pastures. Went to find pre-Hebrew origins.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cruelty for Proust was to see lesbians do something to one of their
father&#146;s photo. Never really understood what. And of course the father&#146;s art was
preserved by one of them too.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The theory is about nomadic circular movement from an umbilical center.
European culture stems from Asia. Now who is barbaric. Herodotus knew it all along. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Shimer College which I attended was a shocking joke. Modeled on the
&quot;Great Books&quot; curriculum. Misfit teachers teaching misfits. Texts were to make
us good citizens. Teachers were as conniving as the next man.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Most outrageous incident at college involved a closeted seventeen year
old black kid from Alabama. Had a note from a doctor which stipulated that he ingest semen
to cure an illness.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My father claimed that he was a victim of anti-Semitism. Beat up walking
to school. Roth finds this suspect. My father&#146;s brother knows nothing of this. Did
Joyce too feign his childhood troubles?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Edward Said on the aesthetics of exile starts me on quest. An enemy
makes us. But my father genuinely is sick in the West. Vestigially Asian. Flannnery
O&#146;connor despises the son that psychologises the father. Fierce, fiery belief.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Heine sees Jews as artwork. Human pyramids. Art survives. So does
plastic. Postmodern Jew is a recycled work of art. Only connect.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Apparently my father was discovered by one of the four founders of
modern dance, a Mr. Charles Weidman. Saved him from alcoholic oblivion due to the loss of
Weidman&#146;s partner Doris Humphrey to marriage.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Worked in New York for years under the banner <i>Expression of Two Arts
Studio</i>. A bunch of materials in Lincoln Center Library. Two arts were calligraphy and
dance. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Was stage manager and designer for Weidman&#146;s choreography. Pieces
still performed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Something happened. A motorcycle accident. Healed by an Asian man. Tai
chi. Saw the wave of the future.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My mother took classes at Weidman&#146;s studio. Met him. Was shocked
that she ate ham.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She was told to be wary. Seemed a psychopath. Caught between
generational motifs. Older in 64, one marries if possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With his knowledge of Asian medicine and a few Asian languages, he could
have been a great scholar or businessman. So could have Kurtz.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Father son conflict will be unheard of in a few decades. Paradigm will
skid. Now, upon reflection, I have wasted my life on this second rate Lear. Ranting in the
Gobi. So did Moses in the Sinai. Deleuze and Guattari compare Moses&#146;s arrangements of
the tribes and Khan&#146;s arrangements of troops. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">His fourth child, a daughter for Lear. But wait, first there was me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Movement has been his underlying aesthetic. All invented. Performance of
the calligraphic hand. Swirling nomadic movement. My children must be take elsewhere in
order to feel alien.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sitting in a small overpriced hotel room in Budapest. We watch the Tyson
hearing. Broadcast of a non-event worldwide. My father is sure that Tyson bit ears to get
away from contractual obligations. He had enough.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He flew from Ulan Bator to Budapest. Why is unclear. Ten hours in Moscow
airport. With him a mountain of junk. My father should be locked up.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With me in Budapest is Faulkner&#146;s <i>Wild Palms</i>. A tattered
library copy. Now published as <i>Jerusalem if I Forget Thee</i>. Worst possible novel I
could have brought.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I have seen much desperation emanate from Faulkner, but this is too
much. The characters frighten me more than anything I have ever read. I thought I had
outgrown seeing myself in fiction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carries with him several of his own passports and those of his
daughter&#146;s. A captive. Perhaps soon a fugitive. We all live a Proustian life.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">An oversized dufflebag. Cheap and old. Plastic. Brings it with him on
the day trip. Absolute insanity. Japanese scholars, a scholar of medieval Egyptian art. A
grotesque woman horribly disfigured by fat wearing biker shorts. Something about Shintoism
and Feminism. American.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I try to be hip writing in a Budapest wine bar. But really there is
nothing ahead. The trip was really stupid. Hungary is a joke. Made up. Me.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There is something seriously wrong with him. Physically he is weak.
Asthma. His mind is demented. I instantly am in my right mind. I break into tears over a
misunderstanding over money. Orchestrated on both our parts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I am requested by an aunt to rescue my half sister from Mongolia.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A half brother has a breakdown and won&#146;t touch his bride.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another half brother is able to make his dick disappear by pushing it
into itself.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Roth writes in <i>Portnoy</i> of the son with the small one seeing his
father&#146;s big one. My father&#146;s penis casts a long shadow.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My step-mother, my father&#146;s wife, got outfoxed. Didn&#146;t realize
that the man that took her out of the cultural revolution was much scarier than Mao.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In college she tells me that she induced an abortion with herbs. A magic
trick she recounts with relish. I don&#146;t get around much.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At seven and eight I would travel long distances to see soccer games in
Israel. O&#146;connor thinks she knows distortion. I&#146;ll give her distortion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Shimer College, I a graduate from perhaps the worst place in the world.
Waukegan, Illinois. Yes, Tom Waits left it &quot;with a slammin of the door&quot;.
Indescribable. The lies and paranoia of the so called faculty. I couldn&#146;t be this
unlucky. How could I fall for their alternative muck.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They piece together famous books, allow the students to babble
incoherently on pages they haven&#146;t read, what hellish ring is this.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">College on the verge of bankrupcy in 91, they are awarded a ton of money
by the government for a unique curriculum. It is alternative. No lectures. One big family.
Dostoyevsky&#146;s convict ward.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">College offers an &quot;Oxford Program&quot;. A scam worthy of the
worst. We find our own places and they hire tutors for whatever we want to study. The town
sucks. At least I read Proust.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My father is from Detroit. Passes himself sometimes as a Russian
sometimes as a Mongol. Running away from something. What? Must create enemies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So many Jews identify themselves as white in the singles ads. Why? My
father attempts to pass for all things. <i>Zelig</i> was funnier.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Abandons wife and child in Israel for Chinese woman and settles in
Lorient in Brittany. Has two sons and a daughter. Chinese wife thought she had seduced a
brilliant Westerner that spoke fluent Cantonese and Mandarin. A ticket to go West. Had no
idea that he was psychotic. Ha Ha.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Continually travelling from Chinese Inner Mongolia to what was known as
Outer Mongolia but now simply Mongolia. Inner to Outer. A novelist can make much with this
theme. Artists too of course. Or a coincidence of nomenclature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jerusalem as navel of the world. Perspective of a zealot. No
perspective. Orthodox believe that unbelieving Jews brought death camps on.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Bad blood&quot; links me with Faulkner. Upon my arrival in
Budapest my father asked me for a sample of blood. Ethnic origins. You are not my son. I
wish.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The umbilical cord. A center out of which we traverse. Attachments to my
father inexplicable. Faulkner knew what family blood can do.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Charles Weidman. A childless gay man fathers a fatherless young man. My
father appeared on the Tonight Show when Carson was in New York. Prancing on stage.
Bizarre.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Twenty two citations on the Dance on Disc CD-ROM. Untrained lunatic.
About to be found out he becomes a linguist. Hide behind the language of the Other.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I come across the Khazars. A Serbian writer brilliantly tropes them as
an elixir to be drunk for access to meaning. Asian converts to Judaism. Something to talk
about in Budapest. Really I am hear to bear witness.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thinks he was drawn to Chinese language and culture because of blood
connection. Now my father wants nothing to do with the lowly yellow race. Wants to be with
pure Mongols which I take to mean &quot;white&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There are a few articles on Hitler and the Mongols. There was a
Mongolian division which fought for the Nazis. Also Hitler and Himmler were well aware of
Mongolian military history and made sure to kill any one who may have been a Mongol.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Came to Budapest to tell me that he has a mistress of pure lineage to
the great Khan. &quot;This is how it is done, you rip their clothes off, they either kill
you or fuck you.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One son dragged to Israel. Two other sons grow up speaking French in a
Paris suburb. Jewish father (read God) and Chinese wife speak Mandarin and English to each
other. They want secret language away from children. They have no idea who this person is.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A last child. A daughter to be raised as a Mongolian princess. When she
is nine he takes her to Inner Mongolia. Can&#146;t handle raising a French girl.
He&#146;ll kill any male that comes near, I suspect.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">His five sisters were all mad. Three brothers have done well.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One son finds a woman who will love him apparently unequivocally. Is a
conniving child at twenty three. Can&#146;t speak Chinese or English and his French is
barely literate. Marries into a very French family. Not intellectual enough to let his
complexes get in the way. Except at the wedding he freaks out. Won&#146;t touch her.
Whispers to me that he prefers Chinese. If tragedy can exist anymore it is located here.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another son lives with two very mad elderly cancerous aunts. Is buff and
a very fine Russian folk dancer, learned his languages of heritage, Cantonese and
Mandarin, at the city colleges of San Francisco. Took all the dance courses. Could have
his pick of men or women. Has taken a vow of celibacy. Won&#146;t allow his father to
continue.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rectifying the misdeeds of nomads who long ago fixed and pinned their
identity to the Hebrew people.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A rage so strong it can&#146;t be captured as text.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Two weeks of non-stop ranting. Thinks he is the world. His visa
problems. His girlfriend&#146;s visa problems. His daughter&#146; visa problems.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><i>If I Forget Thee Jerusalem</i> is either a satire or capitulation to
Hemingway. An expansion of <i>Hills Like White Elephants</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It&#146;s about a flow of water. Faulkner captures it. A terrible
nastiness in this book. Between this text and the nastiness of the text that is my father
I have it pretty bad.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I simply can&#146;t believe the choice of book I took along to Budapest.
I am part of it. Money running out, death nearby. Woman continually referred as a better
man than he. Nothing Asiatic about Budapest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A dot was handed down to Moses. He had to write his own death.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I lived in Brittany for six months. Loved a girl at seven. Demanded to
be taken back to mother in Israel. Have been looking for her ever since.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He was said to have introduced acupuncture to France. Hong Kong medical
credentials. Somehow got away with it. To be able to invent yourself. But he flipped.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To be in love with forms. A question of authenticity. Post-structural
jargon: loss, gap, silence, effacement, space.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bloom is selling ads. Zion is at home in bed with wife; real estate
unspecified. Walking the ancient streets of Jerusalem I was rejected. In the way of
father&#146;s plans. God&#146;s. Handful of scraps in hand, &quot;Look at the
litter!&quot; Sacred communications stuffed into Herod&#146;s wall, torn out by hands of
child. Don&#146;t mess with Him.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Joyce envisioned a Utopia shaped as a pork kidney. Dublin is as much the
Holy Land as any place. Bloom walking the streets of Jerusalem would not be able to get
all of the organ meats he craves. European delicacies don&#146;t transfer well to the
Levant.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 67 Jerusalem is taken back by those claiming descent to Abraham.
Bellow walks the ancient streets and only thinks of Poldy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That scene is <i>Pulp Fiction</i> with Christopher Walken. There it is.
Honor. Gotta honor the memory, man.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bart is beaten up by Nelson. We all experience degradation as children.
You are not special. Yes but to be rejected in the Holy land? While Celts were dancing
naked in Ireland Hebrews created ethical morality. Never mind if they are hypocrites. It
happened there.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Three thousand years of Hebrew existence. What keeps it going? The need
to be other.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To be marked. Yellow, pink. Inevitable that recorded history would be
denied.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Camps are tourist sites. Travel agents making money, while the Swiss are
admonished for making a buck.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bloom is short of promised land by not having full intercourse. Desire
keeps us going. Solidified experience. It is mine. I could have been the messiah. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">I set a fire in Israel. Cool. A young prophet. Turn the place into salt.
Sodomy. Salt adds flavor. Can&#146;t fuck while you are unclean. Damn those rabbinical
dictums.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I now find out that I am a savage trapped in a liberal mindset. No, that
is not what I meant at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To seek out a prostitute in Jerusalem. To reenact some biblical scene.
To go through each stage of literature. To pay her to say YES. To follow a disoriented man
and offer him shelter. To say to the Fisher King, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Words are not sufficient in the land where words had to be an
unrepresented truth.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To get AIDS in Judah. To say in Samaria, &quot;Condos and Burger Kings
and KFCs were not prescribed by Moses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To say that a really awful father who knew Hebrew and Yiddish did not
want to live in Israel. Wasn&#146;t interested in any Jewish culture. Wanted something
more solid. China. But now not China. Khan&#146;s Holy Land. Moses of the Gobi. So he left
wife and son. God is dead. Or he moved.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But it&#146;s alright now, I&#146;m Jumping Jack Flash. Bob Dylan knew
what would sell.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Not to be able to write dance film sing draw or make a bomb. Just get up
on that hill and scream.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To say a young girl is in a foreign land with a Jewish father but he is
wearing a Mongol mask and can someone set the pieces back where they belong please? </font></p>

&nbsp; </span>Yet a &#147;Holocaust mentality&#148; is the best that I can come up with to
describe my father&#146;s state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Holocaust is such a part of my father that he recently imagined a nurse in the hospital
room he was in to be a Nazi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently the
strychnine he was being treated with (for edema) caused him to hallucinate.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My father decided to hang himself.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While hanging he fell to the floor and dislocated
his shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With my father&#146;s luck the
doctors broke his arm trying to put the shoulder back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>There is a moral to this story somewhere.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>I arrived in Paris bearing gifts for my father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A portrait of his grandfather and material from
his New York artist days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My bag was heavy
and I should have taken a cab from Charles DeGaulle Airport.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I was given metro directions and so decided to
take the train.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were many stairs and
tunnels to go through but in the end I found the large courtyard building.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To my disappointment the apartment was on the
fourth flour with a circular staircase and no elevator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>The apartment was tiny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two
smallish rooms and a tiny kitchen and bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
bathroom had two doors, one that led into the bedroom and one into the kitchen.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I hated the thought of being on the toilet next to
people sitting in the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
that&#146;s Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father&#146;s second
wife, a Chinese woman who has lived in France for thirty years, was not doing well
financially it was apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And no wonder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For thirty years she supported a husband and three
children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And when the husband decided to
live abroad she continued to support him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
because he took their daughter.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>Now my father has come back to France with his third wife.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Khavara is thirty three years old.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She is devoted to caring for my father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of his arm, Khavara has to dress, undress
and bath my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She is attractive and
speaks almost fluent English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She also knows
Chinese and sometimes speaks this language with the Chinese wife.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father sometimes speaks Mongolian with his
Mongolian wife but mostly they speak in English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
he speaks fluent French or Chinese with the Chinese wife but mostly everyone speaks
English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese wife has a female
student half her age staying in the apartment with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>This because the student drives her Chinese teacher to workshops and it is
too far to go back to the student&#146;s apartment at the end of the day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The student studies Chinese culture with her
teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The student offers to drive my
father to all of his appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
apparent that the student and Chinese teacher are close.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>The student does not know English too well and my father speaks to her in
French.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father can switch from Chinese to
Mongolian to French to English very easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this respect he is a genius.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>So the apartment is crowded.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
&nbsp; </span>Teacher and student sleep together in the bedroom.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father and his young wife are on a futon in the
other room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sleep on a narrow thin mattress
at the foot of the futon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sight of my
father laying with his wife is a bit jarring but I am tired every night and I fall asleep
pretty quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It was, however, difficult
for me to look at my father in his underwear, a sight I was unable to avoid, as he would
often walk around in his underwear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You would
think that my father was a porn star so big is his cock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>If I didn&#146;t know better I would have thought that he was constantly
erect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But no, his cock was long and would
stretch his underwear out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I myself wore
boxer shorts after taking a shower at night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
occurred to me that the women in the apartment would compare my tiny dick to my
father&#146;s large cock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This thought
satisfied me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let them see what a devoted son
I am.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Let them see the distance I must cover
to reach my father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I hoped all of the
women felt guilty.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Khavara is not a demure country girl.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>She is smart and savvy and realizes that her
husband is not well mentally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She feels it
was her fate to care for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am amazed at
how lucky my father is, but I know he will never show his appreciation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mongolian wife and I become close.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She shares with me a lot.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All Mongolian girls want to marry foreigners and
get out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it is obvious to me that she is
no gold digger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Still life with my miserable
father is better than no life at all in Mongolia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
least she has a hope of getting to the West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
father came into the kitchen while Khavara and I were speaking about this subject.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father became furious saying that Mongolian
youth do not want to leave Mongolia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
course his wife is a Mongolian youth who would know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But my father was very upset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not by
the notion that his wife wants out of her homeland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
by the notion that Mongols prefer Western culture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
father began to berate his wife telling her how wrong she was.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was in the middle but wanted to explore why my
father hated the West, really America, so much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My father said that he hated assimilation especially assimilated Jews
of which he was not. My father sees himself as a &#147;real, observant&#148; Jew.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout my stay in Paris my father would speak
and sing in Yiddish.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I would have wondered
whether his Mongolian wife knew what a Jew was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet
Khavara was very interested in Jews and was very interested in the Yiddish language.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Very strange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>I should have had with me scientific experts on schizophrenia because I
think my father is the perfect example of a &#147;split being&#148;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He went so far as to say that his brothers really
are not his brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He does not know which
mask to wear.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My father came to Paris to settle some affairs.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Primary among these was to renew his &#147;Carte
de Sejour&#148;, his residency card.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
Chinese wife had been paying his taxes for years while he was abroad so that my
father&#146;s French residency would not be jeopardized.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Chinese wife worked in his name and sent most of the money to him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The money had to go to maintain my father&#146;s
townhouse (which he owns) in Beijing, an apartment in Hohote (the capital of Inner
Mongolia) and an apartment in Ulan Bator (the capital of Mongolia).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ex-wife says that my father had an insecure
childhood and needed to have more than one place to live.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>The well has finally run dry, though, and she is out of money.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What the Chinese wife received for her troubles
was a way to stay in France, something my father would never let her forget.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He would claim that she was living on his titles,
never acknowledging that he had never had an income and she was bankrolling him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>My father was very nervous about getting this residency card.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He made us all miserable saying that because the
Chinese wife had moved recently, this put his card in danger.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese wife put my father&#146;s name on the
lease of the tiny apartment so that he could maintain his residency.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For days my father would berate his ex-wife saying
that he would be found out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My father wanted
his present wife and me to know how the Chinese wife swindled him out of money.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would not hear of it and insisted that his
ex-wife was bankrupt after supporting him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Mongolian wife realizes this but sides with her husband to pacify him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>One of the reasons that my father&#146;s place of residence of
25 years in Paris was sold a year ago was so that he could have some money.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another reason was so that the Chinese mother
could pay off some mafia debts incurred by her second son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>My half-brother is living in a half-way house in the gorgeous city of
Aix-en-Provence in the South of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is
in hiding from his Arab debtors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He would
borrow money to gamble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This time he could
not pay back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were friends from high
school and he did not think that it was serious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
threatened to kill his mother and burn their Paris place down.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I believe the sum he owed was $20,000.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His mother borrowed the money from a friend.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>What else did I learn about my half-brother?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We were all at a restaurant when the Chinese
mother told us this tale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This brother, born
in 1974, married in 1997.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The groom would not
sleep with his bride on the wedding night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
this was due to homosexual complexes brought on by being raped when he was 13.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not tell anyone of the rape until after
the marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1999 my brother&#146;s wife
did get pregnant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a difficult birth
which took place in the South of France. A c-section was about to be performed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My brother called his mother in Paris to come and
help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She raced down to the South and at the
last moment (apparently allowed to by the doctors) applied an acupuncture needle.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The baby turned and out it came.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day, perhaps due to the stress of the
birth, my brother struck his beautiful wife in the hospital bed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has not seen wife or child since.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The wife&#146;s parents are suing my brother and
his mother for not divulging to them my brother&#146;s psychological profile.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently these suites are allowed in France
because the Chinese mother is losing the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
suit is another reason that she is broke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
brother is fighting to see the child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
making a divorce difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the above
my father was hearing for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
things get a little sticky with my father&#146;s sons, my father wants no part of it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The mother supports her son with food money while
the state takes care of his housing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Medicine
has not helped my brother&#146;s violent streak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
has beaten up his mother a couple of times and has put a knife to her throat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He needs his father.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I had this father on this trip.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I would have been happy to have shared him.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But when this brother would call his mother while
I was in Paris, my father would refuse to speak to him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Yes he is a lousy father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When I was going to pieces in March of 2002, my father revealed to me that my
mother wrote to him in Mongolia begging him to get in touch with me (imagine a 35 year old
needing to be consoled by his father).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
father was happy to tell me that he refused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>For most of the ten days that I was in Paris it was an exercise in
not disturbing the volcano.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father would
cry from morning to night of how he had been betrayed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>And yet it seemed obvious that he was the one doing the betraying.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More and more my father seemed less than a man and
more like a child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We would be out in public
and my father would not stop sniping at his ex-wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>He had to yell at someone and she was the easiest target.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why she stood for it I don&#146;t know.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think she realizes that he is sick.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did get a chance to speak to my ex-Chinese
step-mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We had lunch together while my
father and his wife went to the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had
become disappointed in her because she had gone to Bosnia and had been baptized as a
Catholic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She says that being a Chinese
Catholic will help her in her business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
was simply appalled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She used to care so much
for my father&#146;s Judaism and her own Buddhism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
at this lunch she said some things that really made sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>I had brought up the subject of the homeless people I work with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How they don&#146;t get along socially and wind up
homeless and how my father resembles this scenario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
she said that my father could never get along with anyone in France whether they were
teachers or potential employers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(He spent 17
years getting degrees from the Sorbonne and never apparently had an income.)<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In China and Mongolia, however, my father was
accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Accepted as being a foreigner that
has mastered their language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Somehow my
father is able to get along in Asia in a way he was not able to in the West.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I suppose this is something to be admired in my
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of being marginalized in one
society he found a way of existing in another. Of course others have paved his way to do
so, though he would never admit to this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
the Holocaust is further away in the East, though the Nazi episode took place in a
Mongolian hospital.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>It was a good piece of luck that the Chinese wife had her
student along for the time that I was there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
student is an archeologist whose specialty is restoration of artifacts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had an opportunity to climb the oldest tower in
Paris which has been closed to the public for four years for restoration.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We took a tour of her office and saw Roman
artifacts in the process of being restored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One
night the student wanted to treat us to a concert in a church and dinner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before the concert we went to the Luxembourg
Gardens and to the Museum Carnavalet which is a museum dedicated to the history of Paris.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We walked a good deal that night.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father could not take some time and appreciate
any of these activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All he could think
of was his own concerns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One morning I could
not take any more of his crying over his residency card (which he got without a problem)
and I said &#147;Genghis Khan did not worry over residency cards&#148;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got a big laugh from the three women in the
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>The student also drove us to my father&#146;s country house about an
hour west from Paris. This was yet another abode his ex-wife had to maintain financially
in my father&#146;s name. I believe he will sign the house over to his daughter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When we got to the house tired from a day of
errands, my father insisted that we clear out the basement of boxes and trunks and put
them in the garage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the basement were
about 10,000 books mostly in Chinese and French.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
books were in beautifully made glass enclosed bookcases made by my brother&#146;s
brother-in-law before the fiasco.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
basement floor were metal trunks and boxes filled with every scrap of paper ever collected
by my father&#146;s family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They (or rather
my father) kept everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was reminded of
my father&#146;s sisters who also were &#147;packrats&#148;.<span
style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese wife called a couple of friends from
a nearby church and paid them to move the stuff.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>We finished at 10:00 at night.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
&nbsp; </span>We then all went to the only restaurant in town, run by a family from
Naples, Italy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We each had our own sumptuous
pizza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At 11:30 we all drove to a nearby
village where the Chinese wife holds workshops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She
is part of a weird Catholic group devoted to &#147;children&#148;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We sat around the table and my father&#146;s
Mongolian wife was asked to sing to us some Mongolian &#147;long songs&#148;.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Mongolian wife stood up and in a lovely voice
began to sing, but to my horror my father sitting next to her, began to accompany her in
the singing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We all wanted to hear her
singing but my father in his typically rude fashion would not or could not see this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When we returned to the country house, I went to
sleep in my sister&#146;s bed which has remained untouched for many years.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p>Two of the days that I was in Paris I was forced to go to the
National Library of France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father was
obsessed with this library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had a card and
his wife had a card (obtained on a previous visit to Paris) and his task was to get me a
research card.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>You have to be interviewed in
order to obtain a card.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to say that
my research subject was yizkor books (the library had 40 of them), but my father insisted
on listing me as his Mongolian studies research assistant. I had to wait an hour to be
interviewed, and was embarrassed by the whole ordeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">
&nbsp; </span>I do have to admit that the library building was amazing, maybe the largest
library in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My father ordered some
books to be brought to him, but he did not do much work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
&nbsp; </span>I think he just was so impressed with himself that he could be in such a
great place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While at the library my
father&#146;s wife used the internet to find organizations that would use her
husband&#146;s consulting services in Mongolia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
father always has a way of getting others to work for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>I don&#146;t know if I will see my father again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I did say that I would go to Mongolia in two
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First I want to return to Israel and
close that chapter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Going to Mongolia would
validate my father further.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Going over there
I would feel that I was humoring an old man.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Drinking
a Bloody Mary with my father one day, he began to sing a famous swing tune called
&#147;St. James Infirmary&#148;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know this
song and sang it with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He ran away from
me and from America, but you can never hide completely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One&#146;s childhood seeps through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
singing the song I think my father began to realize what he lost in me.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> &nbsp; </span>We could have been singing all of these years.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was on my next to last day in Paris that I
myself felt my mission was accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
put on the stereo a recording of Bach violin music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
violin playing was arresting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had never
heard music like this before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps I knew
that something special was in store for me when I chose that compact disc to play.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sat down next to my father and I remember saying
to myself, &#147;this is the sound of redemption&#148;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

might not see you again after I leave Paris.&nbsp; Therefore I want to write you this
letter so that I may tell you about my life and history as it relates to Mikhail.&nbsp;
You&nbsp;said to&nbsp;me that Mikhail has told you about his first wife-my mother.&nbsp;
This bothers me because Mikhail usually sees the past in a very different way&nbsp;from
what&nbsp;others see this same past.&nbsp; I should be the one to tell you about Mikhail's
first marriage NOT Mikhail.&nbsp; I hope you trust me with this.</p>

mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">I
am surprised that Mikhail has told you about his life growing up in America.&nbsp; Mikhail
was never honest with Kar Fung and their two sons about his past.&nbsp; This caused a lot
of problems between us.&nbsp; Mikhail never told his sons that he was from America.&nbsp;
He told them that he was some sort of Russian.&nbsp; Mikhail refused to teach his sons
English so that he could speak to KF in a language that his sons could not
understand.&nbsp; Mikhail also told Kar Fung many false things about his early life.&nbsp;
Mikhail told Kar Fung that his father died when he was a child.&nbsp; This is untrue as
Mikhail's father, Solomon Leash (Lishnofsky), died in 1968.&nbsp; I am sure though that
Mikhail did not have much of a reletionship with his father.</p>

mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">As
I am on the subject of Mikhail's father I will have to address the issue of my heritage
and ancestry.&nbsp; While it is true that Mikhail's father was from South Russia (Crimea,
Ukraine), I can assure you that he was a Jewish man from Russia, without a connection to
Mongolia.&nbsp; I respect Mikhail when he says that he feels Mongolian &quot;in his
blood&quot;.&nbsp; What I will&nbsp;NOT accept is Mikhail changing MY family history for
his own ends.&nbsp; Perhaps centuries ago Mongols/Khazars converted to Judaism and my
ancestry has Asian roots.&nbsp; But as far as the last four or five generations, I can
assure you that my ancestors were simple people, born in Russia as Jews.&nbsp; This is
nothing to be ashamed of although I feel that Mikhail wishes so much to prove that he is
connected to the Mongolian people that he has invented his own ancestry.&nbsp; Mikhail was
born Myron Leash in Detroit in 1939.</p>

mother was born Arlene Swartzberg in 1930.&nbsp; Arlene grew up on Long Island, New
York.&nbsp; My mother is Jewish but she is not religeous.&nbsp; Arlene is a secular
(non-religeous) Jew, as is Mikhail.&nbsp; Arlene went to a dance studio in New York City
to take dancing lessons from a famous dancer named Charles Weidman.&nbsp; Mikhail worked
with Weidman and this is where my parents met.&nbsp; My parents were&nbsp;married in
1964.&nbsp; I was born Steven Santaro in 1966 in New York City.</p>

mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">Mikhail
worked as a translator and as a flight attendant for now defunct TWA (airlines).&nbsp; It
was my mother who supported the family financially as much of the time Mikhail was
studying Chinese and DID NOT WORK.&nbsp; My mother worked as an advertising writer.&nbsp;
My mother also worked hard typing for my father his translation work.&nbsp; So you see,
Mikhail has ALWAYS had women do his work!</p>

a small child I felt very close to my father.&nbsp; Unfortunately my father was away for
long periods of time causing me heartache.Through his job with the airline he was able to
go to Hong Kong.&nbsp; In 1970 Mikhail met Kar Fung in Hong Kong.&nbsp; My mother decided
to follow Mikhail to Hong Kong to try to keep the family together.&nbsp; In Hong Kong
Mikhail took my mother to meet some British Jewish family so that they might hep my mother
and I.&nbsp;This Jewish family recommended that my mother and I emmigrate Israel.&nbsp;
Israel is a Zionist State.&nbsp; This means that all Jews can move to Israel and become
citizens.&nbsp; My mother and I moved to Israel in 1971.&nbsp; Mikhail ASSURED my mother
that he would follow us and live in Israel as a Jew and open up an acupuncture
clinic.&nbsp; I do not know whether my father actually believed that he would do this or
that it was a lie from the beginning.&nbsp; </p>

a side note I would like to say something about the photographs you saw at Saacy showing
Mikhail and Kar Fung in Israel in 1971.&nbsp;I also saw these photographs in 1996 (or
1993).&nbsp; I discussed the pictures with my mother and she said that Mikhail did visit
us in Israel in 1971 but did not tell my mother that he had brought Kar Fung with him on
the trip.&nbsp; This was a rotten thing for Mikhail to do.&nbsp; </p>

mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">Let
me tell you something about my childhood in Israel as most of my trauma occurred
there.&nbsp; I was an American going to school with Israeli children.&nbsp; I was a little
smarter than most children and so I was bullied a lot.&nbsp;Since you told me of your own
childhood traumas being a Mongolian minority in a Chinese school, you should understand
how it was.&nbsp;My mother never learned Hebrew-the language of Israel.&nbsp; My mother
always worked, mostly as an English language secretary.&nbsp; I do not know the number of
times Mikhail came to Israel.&nbsp; I believe it was 2 or 3 times.&nbsp; In 1974 I lived
with Mikhail and Kar Fung in Brittanny, France for 6 months.&nbsp; In 1974 Mikhail came to
Israel for a divorce.&nbsp; In reality my parents had been separated for years.&nbsp; My
father took me for a walk to tell me that now the separation was final.&nbsp; I remember
becoming hysterical (very upset).&nbsp; </p>

have been seeing a psychologist for four years now.&nbsp; I have two talk therapy sessions
a week.&nbsp; I will tell you now of two events I discuss often with my therapist which
occurred in Israel.&nbsp; During one of Mikhail's visits to Israel we took a trip to
Jerusalem.&nbsp; I was 7 or 8 years old.&nbsp; My father and I were to spend a couple of
days in Jerusalem.&nbsp; However on the day of our arrival, something inexplicable (to a
child) happened.&nbsp; Mikhail made other plans and sent me back to my mother.&nbsp; I had
to take a train back to the city of Haifa&nbsp;by myself for two hours.&nbsp; When I
arrived I had to locate my mother at her work which I could not find for hours.&nbsp;
Basically Mikhail abandoned me once more, perhaps because he met a woman, I don't know.</p>

solid black .75pt;mso-border-right-alt:solid black .75pt;padding:0in;
mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">The
second event I speak often about with my therapist is when Mikhail bought some shoelaces
in Israel and placed me on a street corner in Israel to sell these shoelaces.&nbsp; For
what reason?&nbsp; To teach me a lesson?&nbsp; A few days ago you told me a story Mikhail
told you about being 9 years old and shining shoes for money.&nbsp; I really do not
believe this story but I will have to ask his brothers.&nbsp; Anyway even if this did
happen to Mikhail it was wrong to humiliate his son in this way.</p>

you already know that a son needs a father.&nbsp; You know what has happened to Tuo
Ling.&nbsp; Bian Ling too has suffered for not having a capable father.&nbsp; Perhaps you
are enough of a caretaker for my sister that she has not suffered as bad as her brothers
have.</p>

mso-padding-alt:0in 0in 0in 0in">A
few more facts.&nbsp; In 1982 Mikhail visited my mother and me in Chicago.&nbsp;Mikhail
had been invited to talk at an acupuncture school in Chicago.&nbsp;I had not seen him in
years.&nbsp; I was 16 years old and deperately needed a connection with my father.&nbsp;
But all Mikhail did was study his Mongolian dictionary.&nbsp; Mikhail would not speak to
me.&nbsp; In 1985 I visited the Santaro family in Ivry.&nbsp; I was unable to communicate
with my brothers because Mikhail had not taught them English.&nbsp; In 1993 I tried again
to establish something with Mikhail.&nbsp; However I found myself in the middle of a fight
between Mikhail and Tuo Ling, so I left soon after arriving.</p>

have suffered from clinical depression all of my life.&nbsp; It is only in the last couple
of years, with the help of talk therapy and medicine, that I have been able to lead a more
normal life without depression crippling me.</p>

may wonder about my romantic life.&nbsp; I have never had a girlfiend.&nbsp; I am very
afraid of rejection.&nbsp; This stems from my feeling rejected as a child.&nbsp; I do not
blame Mikhail entirely, but having a father may have helped me deal better with women.</p>

have told you that all 5 of Mikhail's sisters suffer from some sort of mental
psychosis.&nbsp; You can verify this easily.&nbsp; Unfortunately Tuo Ling seems to have
inherited this family disease.&nbsp; I leave it up to you to determine if Mikhail suffers
similarly.&nbsp; </p>
