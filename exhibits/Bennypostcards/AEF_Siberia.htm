<p>My favorite photograph of my grandfather shows him dressed in the costume of a native
Russian. Anyone seeing this photo would assume that it was taken in my grandfather&#146;s
shtetl in Kovno Guberniya before he immigrated to America in 1905. The photograph indeed
was taken in Russia, although some 15 years <i>after</i> my grandfather first came over to
America. So what was he doing back in Russia? My grandfather, Benny Swartzberg, was
serving his adopted country of America as a United States soldier serving in the American
Expeditionary Forces in Siberia.</p>

<p>Benny Swartzberg passed away in 1985, a member of the Veteran of Foreign Wars. I was 19
when he died, and I regretted not speaking to him more about his life. For the past few
years I have been researching his life so that I may learn more about his unique immigrant
experience. Helping me in my research is a family album of photographs and my
grandfather&#146;s remarkable postcard collection.</p>

<p>Benny left his shtetl of Panimunok (now Panemunelis, Lithuania) at the age of 15. He
settled in Whitman, Massachusetts, and worked in the shoe factories in the nearby city of
Brockton. My grandfather had two hobbies as a young man -- taking photographs and
collecting postcards. Many of the postcards collected by Benny were of Jewish themes and
personalities. My grandfather was a great lover of Yiddish and an ardent Zionist and he
collected postcards of famous Yiddish writers and Zionists. I have learned a great deal
about my grandfather based on the postcards he collected.</p>

<p>When I began my research into my grandfather&#146;s life, I became quite intrigued by
his Army Service. Some of the most interesting photographs and postcards are those from
his days that he served in the United States Army. The photos and postcards were from the
Philippines and Siberia. There is a photo of a Russian sleigh carrying US soldiers and an
American flag, a photo of a Russian nurse and a White Russian soldier; one photo shows a
US soldier guarding the Trans-Siberian Railway. I also have two dozen photos and postcards
of native life and street scenes of Manila. I began to research the mission that brought
my grandfather back to Russia. </p>

<p>After traveling across America with a friend, Benny Swartzberg enlisted in San
Francisco in April of 1917, a couple of months before the draft. He trained at Fort
McDowell in San Francisco and was placed in the 27<sup>th</sup> Infantry. Shortly
thereafter the 27<sup>th</sup> Infantry was shipped to the Philippine Islands. In August
of 1918 the 27<sup>th</sup> Infantry along with the 31<sup>st</sup> Infantry was ordered
to ship to Vladivostok, Siberia. 10,000 US soldiers were to remain in Siberia until April
of 1920.</p>

<p>By all accounts the AEF Siberian mission was ill advised. The troops had no clear
purpose, except to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway. The US Army was caught in the
middle of the Russian civil war but was not allowed to openly side with the White Russians
who were desperately fighting the Bolsheviks. I often have wondered on which side my
grandfather&#146;s sympathies were. I would like to have known how he felt serving in the
United States Army in Siberia as a Jewish man. How was my grandfather&#146;s strong
Yiddish accent perceived by his fellow soldiers and by the local Russians? How did he feel
being back in Russia?</p>

<p>While serving in Siberia as a US soldier, my grandfather was not yet a United States
Citizen. Immediately upon his discharge in San Francisco in April of 1920, Benny
Swartzberg took out his naturalization papers to become a United States citizen. He then
went straight back to <a href="http://www.jewishgen.org/Shtetlinks/Brockton/Brockton.htm">Brockton,
Massachusetts</a> and married his betrothed.</p>

<p>The following are the resources I have used to learn about the AEF Siberia mission:</p>

<p><u>Red Victory: a history of the Russian Civil War</u> by </p>

<p>W. Bruce Lincoln. Publisher New York Simon and Schuster, c1989. </p>

<p>I highly recommend a very interesting and entertaining first hand account of the AEF
Siberia by an officer in the 27<sup>th</sup> Infantry:</p>

<p><u>American Soldiers in Siberia</u> by</p>

<p>Sylvian Kindall, 1945 (this book is in some libraries and is available for purchase
from military bookstores)</p>

<p><u>Siberia's Untouched Treasure: Its Future Role in the World</u></p>

<p>Channing, C. G. Fairfax:&nbsp; ; New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1923.&nbsp;&nbsp; A
treasure of a book with 80 photographs from the AEF Siberia.</p>

<p>I also learned of the exact movements of the 27th Infantry in:</p>

<p><u>Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War</u></p>

<p><u>Volume 1, published by the Center of Military History</u></p>

<p><u>United Stated Army, 1988</u></p>

<p>There is a videotape comprising of Signal Corps footage from the AEF Siberia:</p>

<p><u>&quot;American Siberian Expeditionary Force&quot; previously issued as a motion
picture in 1963 under title: AEF in Siberia. </u></p>
