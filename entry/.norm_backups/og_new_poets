אַבֿרהם סוצקעווער@Avrom Sutzkever@1913-07-15@2010-01-20@Avrom Sutzkever was born in Vilna, and spent his early childhood years in Siberia. After returning to Vilna with his mother, he studied Polish and Russian poetry, and joined the distinguished literary circle "Yung Vilna" along side other famous poets such as Chaim Grade and Shmerke Kaczerginski. He and his wife Freydke Sutzkever were confined to the Vilna ghetto in 1941. During that time, Sutzkever worked in the "Paper Brigade", and smuggled irreplaceable cultural treasures out of the Nazis hands and into the ghetto. In 1943, before the ghetto was liquidated, he escaped to the forest with his wife and they joined the partisans.
Avrom and Freydke Sutzkever settled in Tel Aviv, where he founded Yiddish literary journal "Di Goldene Keyt". 
Sutzkever's poems are neoclassical, modernist, and have a certain melodic quality - many have been set to music. In his shorter poems and long epics alike, he writes with stunning imagination, and calls upon transcendent images of the natural world.@avrom_sutzkever.jpg@From the Archives of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York@@
